## Welcome to Fan Layout Manager for Android original by Cleveroad updated by Apollo29

Fan Layout Manager is a library original created at Cleveroad. Our ideas don’t come from nowhere, everything we invent results from the difficulties we overcome. This exactly what happened — we were fighting uniformity! Since traditional view of the simple horizontal list isn’t impressive anymore, we decided to suggest our vision adding some colours and a completely new motion path.
